            Healing is everything. I’m happiest when I’m fishing, digging up fossils, and decorating my island.
            Filling up the <strong>museum</strong> is the best part — watching it grow gives me such a satisfying feeling,
            like all the stress from real life is melting away.

            It’s like an escape-room puzzle game. When I play with friends,
            we keep <em>pulling, pushing, and dropping</em> each other, and we can’t stop laughing 😂.
            There are so many silly moments that we end up with tears in our eyes.
            Playing together on Discord helped me meet new people and become closer while having fun.

            Who did it, where, and with what? <strong>Deduction</strong> is the heart of this classic mystery.
            I love taking notes, forming hypotheses, and the little bluffing mind games.
            We once got so absorbed that we didn’t notice how late it was —
            rushing to finish ended up being the funniest part.

          <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">
            I’ve learned violin as a hobby since elementary school and performed on stage with orchestras several times.
            When I get tired of studying, it’s the best way to <strong>clear my head</strong>.
            I joined the university club in 2024; I later paused to focus on academics, and I really miss performing.

            A precious time with my family on Jeju, surrounded by the blue sea and stone walls.
            It was our first trip together after my entrance exams — and my first time in Jeju, which made it even more exciting.
            I hope to visit again with people I love.
            The sea breeze and our laughter still linger in my heart.
            We forgot the fatigue of daily life and listened to each other — a warm, relaxing trip. 🌺

            A trip to Hong Kong with my cousins 🇭🇰<br>
            We chatted endlessly while waiting in the long line at Bakehouse for sweet egg tarts.
            Since we rarely meet, spending so much time together abroad felt extra special.
            Even waiting in line was fun that day.
            The next day we went to Disneyland and spent the whole day reliving our childhood 🎢
            Looking at the dazzling night skyline, I thought, “Someday I want to live in a city full of lights like this.”

            Cycling along the harbor and feeling the cool sea air, I could sense both the energy and calm of the city 🚴‍♀️🌊<br><br>
            Our hotel offered sweeping skyline views — blue skies by day and sparkling lights at night — 
            the perfect cure for a long day’s fatigue ✨<br><br>
            Amid the city’s sophistication, people’s warm smiles made me feel at ease.
            An unforgettable, heartwarming trip 🌺

            We visited the location from the dating scene in <em>Your Name</em>, enjoyed an exhibition, and sipped a warm drink —
            it felt like stepping into a movie ☕💫<br>
            Our shopping bags kept piling up, and at Disneyland we laughed all day and made unforgettable memories 🎢🎀<br>
            It was a calm and happy trip, made even more special because we were together 🌸
