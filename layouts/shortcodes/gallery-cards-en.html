            Healing is everything. I love fishing, digging up fossils, and decorating my island.
            The <strong>museum</strong> is my favorite part — watching it grow and fill up gives me a deep sense of satisfaction.
            Every time I see new exhibits, it feels like all the stress from real life melts away.

          <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">
            It’s like an escape-room puzzle game. Playing with friends means
            <em>pulling, pushing, and falling together</em>, and the result is always endless laughter 😂.
            We often end up crying from laughing too hard when someone slips or drops the other off a cliff.
            Playing over Discord with multiple people helped me connect and make new friends while having fun.

          <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">
            Who did it, where, and with what? <strong>Deduction</strong> is the key in this classic mystery board game.
            I love the process of taking notes, forming hypotheses, and engaging in bluffing battles.
            One time we were so absorbed in solving the case that we didn’t notice how late it was —
            trying to wrap up the game in a hurry ended up being the funniest part.

          <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">
            I’ve been playing the violin since elementary school and have performed in several orchestral concerts.
            It’s one of my favorite ways to <strong>refresh my mind</strong> when I’m tired of studying.
            In 2024, I joined the university’s violin club, and even though I later stopped to focus on my studies,
            I still miss the experience of performing on stage.

            It was a precious time spent with my family on Jeju Island, surrounded by the blue sea and endless stone walls.
            It was our first trip together after my college entrance exams — and my first time visiting Jeju, which made it even more exciting.
            I hope to visit again someday with people I love.
            The scent of the sea carried by the wind and the sound of our laughter still linger in my heart.
            It was a relaxing and heartwarming journey where we forgot the fatigue of daily life and listened to each other’s stories. 🌺

            A trip to Hong Kong with my cousins 🇭🇰
            We chatted endlessly while waiting in the long line at Bakehouse for their famous sweet egg tarts.
            Since we don’t get to see each other often, spending so much time together abroad felt especially joyful.
            Even waiting in line was fun that day.
            The next day, we went to Disneyland and spent the whole day reliving our childhood 🎢
            Looking at the dazzling night skyline, I thought, “Someday, I want to live in a city full of lights like this.”

            A warm breeze welcomed me to Singapore, where I went on a trip with my older sister 🇸🇬
            Riding a bicycle along the harbor and feeling the cool sea breeze, I could sense both the energy and calmness of the city 🚴‍♀️🌊
            Our hotel offered a breathtaking view of the skyline — blue skies during the day and sparkling lights at night.
            The scenery made me forget all the fatigue of the day ✨
            Amid the city’s sophistication, the warm smiles of the people made me feel at ease.
            It was an unforgettable, heartwarming trip 🌺
