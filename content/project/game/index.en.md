### 🎮 Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **2D simulation game** where an **AI agent learns to play autonomously** through **reinforcement learning**.  
The AI interacts with the environment, receives rewards, and gradually learns an optimal strategy without explicit supervision.  
Both the environment and learning logic were custom-built to visualize the agent’s **training, exploration, and decision-making process**.

### ⚙️ Key Features and Implementation  
- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:**  
  Implemented **DQN (Deep Q-Network)** and **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** to enable the agent to learn policies through trial and reward feedback  
- **Custom Game Engine:**  
  Built a lightweight 2D engine using **Pygame**, including movement, collision detection, and reward mechanics  
- **Visualization and Analysis:**  
  Visualized learning progress and behavior patterns through real-time graphs and animations  
- **Comparative Experiments:**  
  Compared performance metrics between algorithms to derive insights into **learning stability and convergence speed**

### 🧩 Tech Stack  
Python · Pygame · NumPy · Matplotlib · TensorFlow (or PyTorch)

### 💡 Outcome & Learnings  
- Gained a practical understanding of **exploration vs. exploitation** in reinforcement learning  
- Observed how agents optimize strategies through continuous interaction with dynamic environments  
- Combined **game development and AI training** into an interactive and visualized learning system  
- Explored the creative potential of **AI-driven gameplay and autonomous decision-making**
