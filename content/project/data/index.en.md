### üß† Overview  
This section showcases various **data-driven projects** covering the entire data workflow ‚Äî from collection and preprocessing to analysis and visualization.  
It emphasizes the ability to apply data effectively for solving real-world problems.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Contents  
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaned and explored large datasets using Python and Pandas to identify statistical patterns  
- **Visualization Projects**: Created insightful visual representations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly  
- **Machine Learning Practice**: Conducted regression and classification experiments with Scikit-learn and compared model performance  
- **Practical Applications**: Utilized datasets from **Kaggle** and **public data portals** for prediction and classification projects

### üß© Tech Stack  
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

### üéØ Project Goal  
The goal of these projects is to go beyond simple data handling and gain experience in **deriving meaningful insights from data**.  
In the future, this section will be expanded into **web-based interactive data visualization dashboards**.
