### 🧠 Overview  
This project implements a **text-to-image generation system** inspired by **Stable Diffusion** and **DALL·E**.  
Users can input natural language prompts, and the model generates corresponding images that reflect the described concept, style, and composition.  
It explores how **diffusion-based models translate textual semantics into visual features**.

### ⚙️ Key Features  
- Studied and reproduced the **core architecture of diffusion models** for image synthesis  
- Built a **text-to-image pipeline** using pre-trained Stable Diffusion checkpoints  
- Improved image quality through **prompt engineering** and parameter tuning (guidance scale, sampling steps)  
- Added **post-processing scripts** for background removal and resolution enhancement  
- Designed a **Streamlit prototype interface** for interactive generation

### 🧩 Tech Stack  
Python · PyTorch · Hugging Face Diffusers · OpenAI API · Streamlit · Pillow

### 💡 Outcome & Learnings  
- Gained deeper understanding of **latent diffusion mechanisms** and **text embedding representations**  
- Conducted experiments to balance creativity and realism in generated images  
- Developed a **functional prototype** enabling easy access to AI-generated art through a simple web interface
