            Healing is everything. I love fishing, digging up fossils, and decorating my island.
            The <strong>museum</strong> is my favorite part â€” watching it grow and fill up gives me a deep sense of satisfaction.
            Every time I see new exhibits, it feels like all the stress from real life melts away.

            Itâ€™s like an escape-room puzzle game. Playing with friends means
            <em>pulling, pushing, and falling together</em>, and the result is always endless laughter ðŸ˜‚.
            We often end up crying from laughing too hard when someone slips or drops the other off a cliff.
            Playing over Discord with multiple people helped me connect and make new friends while having fun.

          <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">
            Who did it, where, and with what? <strong>Deduction</strong> is the key in this classic mystery board game.
            I love the process of taking notes, forming hypotheses, and engaging in bluffing battles.
            One time we were so absorbed in solving the case that we didnâ€™t notice how late it was â€”
            trying to wrap up the game in a hurry ended up being the funniest part.

          <p class="card-text" style="text-align:justify;">
            Iâ€™ve been playing the violin since elementary school and have performed in several orchestral concerts.
            Itâ€™s one of my favorite ways to <strong>refresh my mind</strong> when Iâ€™m tired of studying.
            In 2024, I joined the universityâ€™s violin club, and even though I later stopped to focus on my studies,
            I still miss the experience of performing on stage.
