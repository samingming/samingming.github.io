👋 Hello! I’m **Jeong Saim**, a junior majoring in **Computer & Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University (JBNU)**.  
I aim to become a developer who keeps learning and improving through consistent practice and reflection.  
My academic journey focuses on bridging the gap between theory and practice — understanding *why* things work, not just *how* they run.  

My passion lies in **web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence**.  
Rather than stopping at completed results, I document my problem-solving process and continuously evaluate what I can improve.  
Every line of code is an opportunity to understand technology more deeply and creatively.  

Each project I create serves as **a personal laboratory for growth**.  
My goal as an undergraduate is to integrate three essential skills — user-centered design, efficient algorithms, and data-driven thinking.  
This portfolio showcases my projects in web applications, AI modeling, and data analytics, and I plan to expand it with new ideas and experiments.
