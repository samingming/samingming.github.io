👋 Hello! My name is Jeong Saim, a junior majoring in Computer & Artificial Intelligence at Jeonbuk National University.
I aspire to become a developer who never stops learning and growing. I consistently work on web and data-driven projects, applying theoretical knowledge from my coursework to real-world implementations. Beyond writing code that simply runs, I strive to understand the deeper meaning of why and how technology impacts user experience and data value.

My curiosity for web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence drives my learning journey. I don’t just aim for completed results — I focus on documenting my problem-solving process, reflecting on areas that need improvement, and strengthening my understanding step by step. Even when writing a single line of code, I make sure to fully grasp why it behaves the way it does.

I consider every project I build as a personal laboratory for growth. My academic goal is to balance three key abilities: a user-centered design perspective, efficient algorithm implementation, and data-driven thinking. This portfolio showcases my projects in web applications, AI modeling, and data analysis — and I plan to keep expanding it with new challenges and ideas.

I know I still have much to learn, but I’m committed to becoming a sincere, persistent developer who grows through continuous learning and self-improvement. Thank you for visiting my page — I hope you’ll enjoy following my journey ahead. 🌱
